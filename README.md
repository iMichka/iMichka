🔧 Engineering Manager | Cloud Infrastructure | DevOps | FinOps | Cybersecurity | Open Source Advocate

I'm currently Engineering Manager of the Infrastructure team at WayKonect (a TotalEnergies subsidiary), based in Lille. I lead the design and operation of our AWS cloud infrastructure supporting the Mobility Business and Charge+ products. I also oversee FinOps strategy and play a key role in cybersecurity for our platforms.

With over a decade of experience as a Python developer (and 3 years in Java), I bring deep technical expertise to my leadership role.

🐙 You can find my open source contributions on GitHub: github.com/iMichka.

I'm passionate about open source and serve on the Homebrew leadership committee.
I'm also the lead maintainer of the pygcxml library.

🎓 I hold a PhD in Physics from the University of Lille 1 and speak French, English, German, Luxembourgish, and a bit of Esperanto.

🏃‍♂️ Outside of work, I’m a dedicated long-distance runner, regularly participating in marathons—and occasionally pushing beyond.
